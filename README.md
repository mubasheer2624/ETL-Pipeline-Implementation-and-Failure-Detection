# ETL-Pipeline-Implementation-and-Failure-Detection
**Project Overview:**
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process used in this project enables the ability to handle enormous volumes of data effectively because of distributed processing capabilites of Apache Spark. It supports several datasets from multiple sources while ensuring sure that just the relevant columns have been selected and combined.

The inclusion of the "pipeline status" column, that dynamically creates data based on predefined conditions, is a crucial aspect of this project. Whether a failure occurred while the ETL process was running is automatically determined by this field. The "pipeline status" column of the resulting dataset is given a value of 1 or 0, signifying the existence or the absence of a pipeline failure, respectively, for each row.
The final dataset is put into a Postgres database after the data has been properly combined and the "failure status" column have been added. This technique permits additional analysis, reporting, and decision-making based on data that has been processed while ensuring confidential storage.
